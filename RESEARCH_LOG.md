## Phase 1: Exploration (Dec 2025 - Feb 2026)

### Paper #1: What Happened to the Quants in August 2007?
*   **Authors:** Khandani & Lo
*   **Key Takeaway:** Even robust math models can fail during "liquidity crunches" when too many funds try to sell the same assets at once. This highlights the importance of "Systemic Risk."

### Paper #2: Pairs Trading: Performance of a Relative-Value Arbitrage Rule
*   **Authors:** Gatev, Goetzmann, & Rouwenhorst
*   **Key Takeaway:** Historical proof that mean-reversion between "twin" stocks (like KO and PEP) can generate consistent profit, proving the market isn't always perfectly efficient.
