## 📈 Active Strategies

### Strategy #1: Statistical Arbitrage (Mean Reversion)
*   **Assets:** KO (Coca-Cola) / PEP (PepsiCo)
*   **Status:** ✅ VERIFIED
*   **Methodology:** 30-day rolling Z-score model.
*   **Research Finding:** Analyzed 500 trading days; identified 39 buy signals (Z < -2) and 21 sell signals (Z > 2). This confirms that even with long-term ratio drift, short-term statistical anomalies remain tradable.
*   **Files:** `statarb_ko_pep.py`, `pair_data.csv`, `statarb_signals.png`

### Strategy #2: Time-Series Momentum
*   **Assets:** NVDA / AMD
*   **Concept:** Capturing trend persistence in the semiconductor sector using moving average crossovers and RSI filters.
*   **Status:** Phase 1 implementation complete.
