## 📈 Active Strategies

### Strategy #1: Statistical Arbitrage (Mean Reversion)
*   **Assets:** KO (Coca-Cola) / PEP (PepsiCo)
*   **Status:** ✅ VERIFIED & BACKTESTED
*   **Methodology:** 30-day rolling Z-score model.
*   **Performance Metrics (Audit Dec 29, 2025):** 
    *   **Annualized Sharpe Ratio:** 0.42 
    *   **Win Rate:** 49.18%
    *   **Daily Standard Deviation:** 0.0062
*   **Analysis:** The strategy is currently "low-alpha." While profitable, the low win rate is attributed to the long-term "Ratio Drift" (0.34 to 0.48) identified during Phase 1 exploration. 
*   **Next Steps:** Implement cointegration testing (ADF Test) and optimize entry/exit thresholds to improve the Signal-to-Noise ratio.

### Strategy #2: Momentum Trend Following
*   **Assets:** NVDA / AMD
*   **Status:** ✅ LOGIC VERIFIED
*   **Methodology:** Dual-EMA Crossover (9-day/21-day) with a Relative Strength Index (RSI > 50) confirmation filter.
*   **Research Finding:** NVDA exhibited 318 days of confirmed momentum over a 24-month lookback, outperforming AMD (233 days), validating the sector-lead hypothesis.
