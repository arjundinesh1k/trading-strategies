## 📈 Active Strategies

### Strategy #1: Statistical Arbitrage (Mean Reversion)
*   **Assets:** KO (Coke) / PEP (Pepsi)
*   **Status:** ✅ BACKTESTED & OPTIMIZED
*   **Performance:** **1.18 Sharpe Ratio** (Z-Score Threshold: 3.0)
*   **Finding:** Identified that high-frequency "noise" was lowering performance. Moving to a conservative 3.0 threshold improved the quality of trades and strategy robustness.

### Strategy #2: Momentum Trend Following
*   **Assets:** NVDA / AMD
*   **Status:** ✅ BACKTESTED
*   **Performance:** **0.95 Sharpe Ratio** (74.14% Total Return)
*   **Risk Note:** Strategy carries a **-47.67% Max Drawdown**. While highly profitable, it requires significant risk tolerance during sector corrections.

### Strategy #3: Cross-Asset Lead-Lag
*   **Assets:** BTC-USD (Lead) / MSTR (Lag)
*   **Status:** ✅ RESEARCH COMPLETED
*   **Finding:** Analyzed the "Echo Effect" between Bitcoin and MicroStrategy. Found that at a daily frequency, the correlation (0.6087) is near-instant.
*   **Conclusion:** No tradable 1-day lag exists, suggesting the market is efficient in pricing the BTC-MSTR relationship.
