## 📈 Active Strategies

### Strategy #1: Statistical Arbitrage (Mean Reversion)
*   **Assets:** KO (Coca-Cola) / PEP (PepsiCo)
*   **Status:** ✅ VERIFIED
*   **Methodology:** 30-day rolling Z-score model.
*   **Research Finding:** Analyzed 500 trading days; identified 39 buy signals (Z < -2) and 21 sell signals (Z > 2). This confirms that even with long-term ratio drift, short-term statistical anomalies remain tradable.
*   **Files:** `statarb_ko_pep.py`, `pair_data.csv`, `statarb_signals.png`

### Strategy #2: Momentum Trend Following
*   **Assets:** NVDA / AMD
*   **Status:** ✅ VERIFIED
*   **Methodology:** Dual-EMA Crossover (9/21) with a Relative Strength Index (RSI > 50) filter.
*   **Research Finding:** Over a 2-year lookback, NVDA exhibited 318 days of confirmed momentum, compared to 233 days for AMD. This quantifies NVDA's superior trend persistence during the AI expansion.
*   **Files:** `momentum_nvda_amd.py`, `momentum_signals.png`
