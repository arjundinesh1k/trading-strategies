# Quantitative Trading Research & Strategy Development
### Focus: Computational Finance | Statistical Arbitrage | Market Microstructure

This repository serves as a professional portfolio and research log for my journey into quantitative finance. My objective is to build a foundation in mathematical modeling and data-driven strategy development, with a specific focus on mean reversion and momentum anomalies.

## 📈 Active Strategies

### Strategy #1: Statistical Arbitrage (Mean Reversion)
*   **Assets:** KO (Coca-Cola) / PEP (PepsiCo)
*   **Status:** ✅ VERIFIED & BACKTESTED
*   **Methodology:** 30-day rolling Z-score model.
*   **Performance Metrics (Audit Dec 29, 2025):** 
    *   **Annualized Sharpe Ratio:** 0.42 
    *   **Win Rate:** 49.18%
    *   **Daily Standard Deviation:** 0.0062
*   **Analysis:** The strategy is currently "low-alpha." While profitable, the low win rate is attributed to the long-term "Ratio Drift" (0.34 to 0.48) identified during Phase 1 exploration. 
*   **Next Steps:** Implement cointegration testing (ADF Test) and optimize entry/exit thresholds to improve the Signal-to-Noise ratio.

### Strategy #2: Momentum Trend Following (NVDA/AMD)
*   **Status:** ✅ BACKTESTED & VERIFIED
*   **Performance Metrics (Audit Dec 30, 2025):** 
    *   **NVDA Sharpe Ratio:** 0.95 (High Performance)
    *   **NVDA Total Return:** 74.14%
    *   **NVDA Max Drawdown:** -47.67% (Significant Risk)
*   **Analysis:** The Dual-EMA model excels at capturing the "AI Expansion" trend. However, the high drawdown suggests the need for a "Stop-Loss" mechanism or a volatility-adjusting position size to protect capital during sector rotations.
